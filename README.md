# Express.js Quick Start

Welcome to the Express.js Quick Start guide! This guide provides you with the steps to set up and run a basic Express.js application.

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chanakorn-aramsak/tourism-fair-registation.git
   ```

Replace **`<repository_url>`** with the actual URL of the repository.

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Use the **`cd`** command to navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tourism-fair-registation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## **Running the Express Application**

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Express application using the following steps:

1. **Start the Server:**

   Run the following command to start the Express server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   You should see the following output indicating that the server is running:

   ```bash
   Server is running on port 3000
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)**. You should see the message "Hello, Express!" displayed in your browser.

## **Additional Information**

- To stop the server, press **`Ctrl + C`** in the terminal where the server is running.
- You can modify the code in **`server.js`** and the project structure to build more advanced applications with Express.js.
